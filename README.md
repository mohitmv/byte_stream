## quick::ByteStream

Note: Moved out to independent repo from the original source at
https://github.com/mohitmv/quick/blob/master/include/quick/byte_stream.hpp

ByteStream is super intuitive, safe, reliable and easy to use utility for binary
serialisation and deserialization of complex and deeply nested C++ objects.
